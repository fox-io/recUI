h3. Recluse's World of Warcraft UI

p. recUI is under development - expect instability.  This UI is written with the intention of being a single, all-purpose UI.  While some features may be basic, the goal is to simply provide all of the functionality with as little overhead as possible.

p. Included you will find most of the familiar UI components that are considered staples of a UI.

* Scrolling combat text
* Custom action bar
* Damage meter
* Threat meter
* Custom, square minimap
* Raid timers (under development)
* Custom world map
* Instant messenger style whispers
* Custom unit frames
* Buff/debuff timers
* All-in-one bag addon (with detached ammo/shards)
* Custom chat frame
* ...And much more!
